### What up, y'all ðŸ‘‹

I'm a big fan of programming languages, well-typed domain models, and deep learning.  These days I'm into functional programming in Scala, Rust, Kotlin, and Haskell, and I spend a lot of time contributing to the FP ecosystem at [47 Degrees](https://47degrees.github.io/org/).  I believe in  the idea that open-source software democratizes the landscape of what we can build on the internet and beyond, and I'm stoked to be working on it full-time.  Outside of coding I'm into music, languages, recreational sports, and playing outside.   

If you want to get in touch with me to talk about programming, work on open-source together, or even just say hi, I can be reached at my `$myGithubUsername@gmail.com`, or just hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dmarticus/).

Peace.
