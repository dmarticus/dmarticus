### What up, y'all ðŸ‘‹

I'm a big fan of programming languages, well-typed domain models, and data science.  I enjoy programming in Haskell, Scala, TypeScript, Rust, Python and Kotlin; and I currently work at [Mercury](https://mercury.com/), using Haskell, React, and TypeScript to build the next generation of digital banking.  Before Mercury, I spent some time contributing to the open-source Scala ecosystem during my brief stint at [47 Degrees](https://www.47deg.com/) (I'm still a maintainer of the [higherkindness](https://github.com/higherkindness) functional programming libraries).  Before 47 Degrees, I worked at [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/qualtrics-life/why-qualtrics-dylan-martin-software-engineer-seattle-wa/) for 5 years, where I worked on observability infrastructure, test tooling, and internet-scale distributed systems.  Outside of coding I'm into playing music, learning languages, recreational sports, skiing, hiking, climbing, and cooking.

If you want to get in touch with me to talk about programming, work on open-source together, or even just say hi, I can be reached at my `$myGithubUsername@gmail.com`, or hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dmarticus/).  I also (very occasionally) stream myself coding on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/dmarticus); and I much more actively maintain a personal website where [I write](https://dylanamartin.com/blog) and [curate](https://dylanamartin.com/reading) both technical and non-technical content.

Peace.
