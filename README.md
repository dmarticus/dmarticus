### What up, y'all ðŸ‘‹

I'm a big fan of programming languages, well-typed domain models, and deep learning.  These days I'm into functional programming in Scala, Rust, Kotlin, and Haskell, and I spend a lot of time contributing to the FP ecosystem at [47 Degrees](https://47degrees.github.io/org/).  I think open-source software democratizes the landscape of what we can build on the internet and beyond, and I'm stoked to be working on it full-time.  Before that I worked at [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/qualtrics-life/why-qualtrics-dylan-martin-software-engineer-seattle-wa/) for 5 years, where I worked on observability infrastructure, test tooling, and high-scale (35k req/s) distributed systems.  Outside of coding I'm into music, languages, recreational sports, cooking, and playing outside.

If you want to get in touch with me to talk about programming, work on open-source together, or even just say hi, I can be reached at my `$myGithubUsername@gmail.com`, or hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dmarticus/).  I also stream myself coding on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/dmarticus), and I write about tech stuff on [my blog](https://dylanamartin.com/writing.html).  

Peace.
