### What up, y'all.  I'm Dylan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a big fan of programming languages, well-typed domain models, concurrency primitives, automated software testing, and data science. I love working on building foundational systems and software products at early-stage tech companies.

I'm currently a full-stack engineer at [PostHog](https://posthog.com/), where I'm working on building a suite of products to equip every developer in the world with the tools they need to build successful products.

So far in my career, I've been:
* A principal engineer at [BRINC](https://brincdrones.com/), where I founded the web app and cloud services engineering team and built the first version of [LiveOps](https://brincdrones.com/liveops/)
* A founding engineer at [Cercle](https://www.cercle.ai/), where I worked on building consumer apps on top of knowledge graphs for fertility data
* An early employee and generalist engineer at [Mercury](https://mercury.com/), where I wore many hats but mostly owned international payments
* A software consultant and open-sourcerer at [47 Degrees](https://www.47deg.com/), where I mostly wrote Scala and got hired by clients to fix their distributed systems and write good code
* A tech lead and senior IC at [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/qualtrics-life/why-qualtrics-dylan-martin-software-engineer-seattle-wa/), where I worked on a variety of projects relating to observability infrasture, test tools, and web-scale distributed systems.

Outside of coding I'm into playing music, fashion, design, learning languages, recreational sports, lifting, skiing, hiking, climbing, and cooking.

If you want to get in touch with me to talk about programming, work on open-source together, or even just say hi, I can be reached at `$myGithubUsername@gmail.com`.  I also (very occasionally) stream myself coding on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/dmarticus); and I much more actively maintain a personal website where [I write](https://dylanamartin.com/blog) and [used to curate](https://dylanamartin.com/reading) both technical and non-technical content.

Peace.
