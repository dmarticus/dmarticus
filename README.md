### What up, y'all.  I'm Dylan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a big fan of programming languages, well-typed domain models, and data science.  I'm a polyglot programmer who's written production code in a variety of languages, but I prefer functional programming with static types (Haskell, Scala, Typescript, a bit of Rust) for production use (although I still love Python for doing experiments and data science).  

I currently work at [Mercury](https://mercury.com/), where I work with an uber-talented team on building the best banking stack for startups and other digital businesses.  Before Mercury, I worked as an sofware engineering consultant and spent some time contributing to the open-source Scala ecosystem during my brief stint at [47 Degrees](https://www.47deg.com/).  Before 47 Degrees, I worked at [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/qualtrics-life/why-qualtrics-dylan-martin-software-engineer-seattle-wa/) for 5 years, where I worked as a tech lead and an individual contributor on a variety of projects: observability infrastructure, test tooling, and web-scale distributed systems.  Outside of coding I'm into playing music, fashion, design, learning languages, recreational sports, skiing, hiking, climbing, and cooking.

If you want to get in touch with me to talk about programming, work on open-source together, or even just say hi, I can be reached at my `$myGithubUsername@gmail.com`, or hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dmarticus/).  I also (very occasionally) stream myself coding on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/dmarticus); and I much more actively maintain a personal website where [I write](https://dylanamartin.com/blog) and [curate](https://dylanamartin.com/reading) both technical and non-technical content.

Peace.
