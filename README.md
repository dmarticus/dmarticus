### What up, y'all.  I'm Dylan ðŸ‘‹

I love building and scaling foundational systems and software products at early-stage tech companies.

Currently:
- I'm a [product engineer](https://posthog.com/blog/what-is-a-product-engineer) at [PostHog](https://posthog.com/), where I'm the tech lead for our [feature flags product](https://posthog.com/teams/feature-flags)

So far in my career, I've been:
* A principal engineer at [BRINC](https://brincdrones.com/), where I founded the web app and cloud services engineering team and built the first version of [LiveOps](https://brincdrones.com/liveops/)
* A founding engineer at [Cercle](https://www.cercle.ai/), where I built consumer apps on top of knowledge graphs for fertility data
* An early employee and generalist engineer at [Mercury](https://mercury.com/), where I wore many hats and owned international payments
* A software consultant and open-sourcerer at [47 Degrees](https://www.47deg.com/), where I wrote Haskell and Scala and was hired fix distributed systems and champion good code
* A tech lead and senior IC at [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/qualtrics-life/why-qualtrics-dylan-martin-software-engineer-seattle-wa/), where I worked on a variety of projects relating to observability infrasture, test tools, and web-scale distributed systems.

Outside of coding I'm into playing music, fashion, design, learning languages, recreational sports, lifting, skiing, hiking, climbing, and food.

If you want to get in touch with me to talk about programming, work on open-source together, or even just say hi, I can be reached at `$myGithubUsername@gmail.com`.

Peace.
