### What up, y'all.  I'm Dylan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a big fan of programming languages, well-typed domain models, concurrency primitives, and data science.  I'm a polyglot programmer who's written production code in a variety of languages, but I prefer functional programming with static types (Haskell, Scala, Typescript, a bit of Rust) for production use (although I still love Python for doing experiments and data science).  

I'm currently exploring!  I'm working on some fun personal projects, messing around in new programing languages, and generally learning more about the current the tech landscape. 

So far in my career, I've been:
* An early hire at [Mercury](https://mercury.com/), where I worked on a ton of things that come with working at a startup, but I mostly owned international payments
* A software consultant and open-source maintaner at [47 Degrees](https://www.47deg.com/), where I mostly wrote Scala and got hired by clients to fix their distributed systems and write good code
* A tech lead and senior IC at [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/qualtrics-life/why-qualtrics-dylan-martin-software-engineer-seattle-wa/), where I worked on a variety of projects relating to observability infrasture, test tools, and web-scale distributed systems.  

Outside of coding I'm into playing music, fashion, design, learning languages, recreational sports, skiing, hiking, climbing, and cooking.

If you want to get in touch with me to talk about programming, work on open-source together, or even just say hi, I can be reached at my `$myGithubUsername@gmail.com`, or hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dmarticus/).  I also (very occasionally) stream myself coding on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/dmarticus); and I much more actively maintain a personal website where [I write](https://dylanamartin.com/blog) and [curate](https://dylanamartin.com/reading) both technical and non-technical content.

Peace.
